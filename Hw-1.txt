1. What is HTML? What does it do? HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language, which tells the browser, via tags (containers), specific instructions as to how the information within the opening and closing tags will be presented and structured. HTML is used to structure the webpage and the content to be added to it. 

2. What is CSS? What does it do?  CSS is a cascading style sheet, which is the language used for styling and designing websites. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on a webpage.

3. Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user. The web page structure demarcates articles of most significance on a responsive basis. When seen on a mobile device, the page will have an image and link to the most important article (implied in its size) take up the length of the entire screen, and on a desktop, it will be the largest article to the left of the others (our eyes naturally read from left to right). All colored text and text near an icon are implied to be clickable by the user. The most inquired topics: ‘About,’ ‘Mission,’ ‘Academics,’ etc., are dropdown menus when hovered over and direct links to each topic’s general info page when clicked. Overall, this structure of making the most important bigger, positioning to the left, and nesting links within links gives the user what one would assume to be an answer to any question they may have had upon arriving at the website. 

4. What is an HTML element? Tag? Attribute? An HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. The tag is an instruction that tells web browsers how to structure and display a webpage. An attribute is what provides addition information about HTML elements, like color or size.

5. What are the parts of a CSS rule? The parts of a CSS rule are the selector and declaration block, the part that points to the HTML element that needs to be styled, and the part that contains the declaration(s).

6. Explain how CSS rules cascade. CSS rules cascade by following a priority when there's a conflict: browser defaults, external stylesheets, internal styles, inline styles, and then anything marked as !important. Within the same stylesheet, rules are applied based on specificity: inline styles are the strongest, followed by ID selectors, then class selectors, and then element selectors. If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the file is executed. Using !important makes a rule override others (to be noted that this is a method that the professor has strongly advised against). 

7. If you have a directory called project-1 that contains two subdirectories, html-files and images. In the html-files directory you have an HTML file called html-1.html that has an img element with a src attribute, write out the value of the src attribute to access an image file called pinecone.jpg in the images directory. 


	<img src = “../images/pinecone.jpg” alt = “Professor’s Cute Cat”>

8. What is the default behavior when submitting a HTML form? When you submit an HTML form, the browser sends the info to a server (or the same page if no server is set). The page usually reloads, and depending on whether you're using "GET" or "POST," the data either gets added to the URL or sent behind the scenes.
