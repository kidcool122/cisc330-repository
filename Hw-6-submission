Homework 6 
1. What is PHP? What do server side languages do in web development? PHP is an interpreted programming language used to build dynamic webpages and web apps. Server side languages process user input and interact with other servers (ensure secure, scalable, and powerful back-end logic)
2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ? Both PHP and JavaScript support object-oriented programming and can be embedded in HTML and used to manipulate web content. However, PHP is executed on the server (back-end), while JavaScript is run on the client side of the browser usually (front-end), so they vary by use case. 
3. Why pick PHP over another server side scripting language? PHP is “probably the most opinionated scripting language to be used for web development”, integrates seamlessly with popular databases like mySQL, and it is open-source. 
4. What’s the difference between the include and require keywords in PHP? a. What would happen if you tried to use a variable from a file that hasn’t been included yet?  The difference is for include, if the specified file is not found or cannot be included, PHP will provide a warning but continue executing the script. For require, if the file is not found there will be a ‘fatal error’ returned and the execution of the entire will be precluded. 
5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump. Both are PHP functions, output to the browser, and can be used to output variables. The differences are echo is used for outputting simple values while var_dump is generally for detailed information about variables (type, value, etc.), and echo prints just the value while var_dump outputs the value and its data type.
