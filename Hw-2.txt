3. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that organizes items in a single row or column, focusing on alignment and distribution along the main and cross axes. In contrast, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for complex arrangements of items in both rows and columns, providing more control over the overall structure. While both systems are declarative and facilitate responsive design, Flexbox is best suited for simpler layouts, whereas CSS Grid excels in more intricate designs. Both use similar alignment and spacing properties, but their applications and layout capabilities differ significantly.
