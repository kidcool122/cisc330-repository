1. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree?

The Dom tree is the model of the page that the browser loads, and it contains four main types of nodes: document, element, attribute, and text nodes.

We use it because it “ takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code” (simplifies the code and shortens the syntax). To load jQuery onto a page, you can include it using a script tag in the HTML file, referencing a hosted version from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Google or jQuery's official CDN
